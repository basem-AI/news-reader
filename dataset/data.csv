However, studying the free-flight of insects can be challenging due to their high speed of motion and small size. Furthermore, existing approaches to study insect flight can cause the insect to fly unnaturally, thus limiting any insight gained. Pannequin et al. track the free-flight of insects in natural conditions with limited disturbance using a cable robot called ""lab-on-cables."" The cable robot is an open cage mounted with cameras. The cage, attached to cables, moves automatically with the flying insect to track the insect's flight. This month's cover is a photograph of the lab-on-cables. [CREDIT: D.

"ONLINE COVER Lab on Wires. Understanding how insects fly may inspire future developments in micro-aerial robotics. However, studying the free-flight of insects can be challenging due to their high speed of motion and small size. Furthermore, existing approaches to study insect flight can cause the insect to fly unnaturally, thus limiting any insight gained. Pannequin et al. track the free-flight of insects in natural conditions with limited disturbance using a cable robot called ""lab-on-cables."" The cable robot is an open cage mounted with cameras. The cage, attached to cables, moves automatically with the flying insect to track the insect's flight. This month's cover is a photograph of the lab-on-cables. [CREDIT: D.

"ONLINE COVER Lab on Wires. Understanding how insects fly may inspire future developments in micro-aerial robotics. However, studying the free-flight of insects can be challenging due to their high speed of motion and small size. Furthermore, existing approaches to study insect flight can cause the insect to fly unnaturally, thus limiting any insight gained. Pannequin et al. track the free-flight of insects in natural conditions with limited disturbance using a cable robot called ""lab-on-cables."" The cable robot is an open cage mounted with cameras. The cage, attached to cables, moves automatically with the flying insect to track the insect's flight. This month's cover is a photograph of the lab-on-cables. [CREDIT: D.

However, studying the free-flight of insects can be challenging due to their high speed of motion and small size. Furthermore, existing approaches to study insect flight can cause the insect to fly unnaturally, thus limiting any insight gained. Pannequin et al. track the free-flight of insects in natural conditions with limited disturbance using a cable robot called ""lab-on-cables."" The cable robot is an open cage mounted with cameras. The cage, attached to cables, moves automatically with the flying insect to track the insect's flight. This month's cover is a photograph of the lab-on-cables. [CREDIT: D.

"ONLINE COVER Lab on Wires. Understanding how insects fly may inspire future developments in micro-aerial robotics. However, studying the free-flight of insects can be challenging due to their high speed of motion and small size. Furthermore, existing approaches to study insect flight can cause the insect to fly unnaturally, thus limiting any insight gained. Pannequin et al. track the free-flight of insects in natural conditions with limited disturbance using a cable robot called ""lab-on-cables."" The cable robot is an open cage mounted with cameras. The cage, attached to cables, moves automatically with the flying insect to track the insect's flight. This month's cover is a photograph of the lab-on-cables. [CREDIT: D.

However, studying the free-flight of insects can be challenging due to their high speed of motion and small size. Furthermore, existing approaches to study insect flight can cause the insect to fly unnaturally, thus limiting any insight gained. Pannequin et al. track the free-flight of insects in natural conditions with limited disturbance using a cable robot called ""lab-on-cables."" The cable robot is an open cage mounted with cameras. The cage, attached to cables, moves automatically with the flying insect to track the insect's flight. This month's cover is a photograph of the lab-on-cables. [CREDIT: D.

"The yield on UK two-year bonds dropped to a fresh record low on Tuesday as a risk-off mood on global markets drove investors towards haven assets such as bonds. Key European markets Frankfurt and Paris closed around 1pc lower as fears resurfaced over a spike in coronavirus infections and renewed lockdowns. Fiona Cincotta, City Index analyst, said: “The shutdown fuels fears that the growing number of coronavirus cases will hamper the fragile economic recovery.” However, rises for some of London’s biggest listed groups – including energy giants Shell and BP – helped the FTSE 100 outperform its continental peers. The benchmark index closed 0.06pc higher at 6,179.75, also thanks to a weaker pound after data showed that the UK economy shrank by almost a fifth in the three months to April. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 slumped 1.21pc to 17,174.69. Telecoms groups BT and Vodafone jumped 4.05pc and 1.66pc respectively, after the Government set out a seven-year timetable for the removal of Huawei equipment from Britain’s fledgling 5G infrastructure. The window gives them more time than had been expected to pull the Chinese group’s tech out of their networks. The decision is likely to benefit European rivals such as Nokia and Ericsson. Meanwhile, hazard detection firm Halma was among the FTSE 100’s biggest fallers, dropping 104p, or 4.5pc, to £21.87 after analysts warned of the pandemic’s impact on the group.",yahoo,UK,2020-07-14,unkown
"Former Barclays banker Roger Jenkins has told a court that he exaggerated the role his ex-wife played in a crisis-era cash call in an attempt to save his marriage. The banker’s success in securing the firm cash for a 2008 rescue deal was believed to partly rest on the shoulders of his former wife Diana, a key networker in their relationship who forged a crucial role in overseeing what she called “the Roger brand”. His former wife is understood to have introduced him to the Qatari prime minister and the chairman of its sovereign wealth fund, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al-Thani, when the couple were on holiday in Sardinia in 2007. The relationship was vital for Barclays, which in 2008 secured a £3.9bn investment from Qatar. However, Mr Jenkins said in court on Tuesday that he was “trying to save my marriage and as a consequence exaggerated her role” when he was discussing how to portray the deal with his PR in 2008. When asked if his contacts really came from his wife at the time, he said: “No, I was going through a very difficult divorce and […] I am perfectly prepared to accept that I exaggerated her role in an effort to save my marriage.” Mr Jenkins was viewed as the gatekeeper to Barclays’ relationship with Qatari investors and played a crucial role in securing their cash for a 2008 rescue deal which saved the lender from a state bailout. He was handed a £50m exit package when he left the bank in 2009, the court heard on Monday. Mr Jenkins is appearing as a witness in a case brought by financier Amanda Staveley, who claims she was treated unfairly when representing Abu Dhabi investors during the rescue and is suing Barclays for £1.6bn. Ms Staveley’s client, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, became the bank’s largest shareholder after contributing £3.5bn to the rescue deal. The case continues.",yahoo,UK,2020-07-14,unkown
